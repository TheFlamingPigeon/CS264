a) It tells the compiler that the fucion trippleMe does exist below and will be looking to return an int along with taking an int when the function is called.

b) You would need to havr the function declearation before the main function otherwise you would get a compliation error.

c) Yes

int tripleMe(int x){ // this is the start of the function definition.

 int result = x * 3;
 return result;
}

d) The first line tells us that the function will take a single int and return an int.

e) The function was called twice in the program specified.
